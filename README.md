# Pre Work Study Guide
## Description
The motivation behind this site was to make a study guide that will organize the pre work study material into sections by topic. It built this project to be able to create an interactive place to study and potential site to place on a resume. I learned a lot about the different components of a website. I also learned about how they interact with each other and how they translate onto a webpage.
